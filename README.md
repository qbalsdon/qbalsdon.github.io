# The source for qbalsdon.github.io

I am trying to make the site better, but I am fairly basic when it comes to web development. Just getting this running was a feat in an of itself.

## Setup

  1. Clone this repo
  2. Try to run the script "runSiteLocally.sh" and follow any instructions
     - `sudo gem install bundler:2.1.4`
     - `bundle install` 
     - `bundle pack`
     - `bundle install --path vendor/cache`

## TODO

  - Test accessibility!
    - Alt text missing!
  - Write more articles
    - Espresso testing framework - "Are Espresso Tests Integration Tests?"
    - What the Fragment? What are fragments supposed to be used for?
