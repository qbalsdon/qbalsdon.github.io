Asking questions can be:
1. Because the answer is important
1. Because the question is important
1. Because the process of asking is important : Reference book

No ViewBinding? LiveData / MVVM? Room? The problem with these types of questions is while they might show some textbook knowledge they definitely do not invite the answerer to demonstrate their usage of Android specifically. I have been in rapid fire situations like that and it ends up feeling like a quiz show more than an interview
