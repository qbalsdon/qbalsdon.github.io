In this session, I will discuss the power of using tickets as a communication tool:

### How to spot a quagmire

1. What are the "ticket-smells" for which we need to look out?
2. Refinement is not just a meeting, it's a practice
3. Understanding the source of the ticket

### Create a to-do list

1. Showing your progress
2. Jira table hacks
3. Organise the list

### Failing fast

1. The power of blocking
2. Mention people
3. Go beyond the board

### Keep commenting

1. Make comments at small milestones
2. Add attachments as evidence

Take back power as a developers

Prevent "Jira pong"

Keep team informed

Tools: adb shell, scripts, scrcpy



If it annoys you as a developer, it's going to annoy your users
