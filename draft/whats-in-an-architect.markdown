<!--

What does it take to become an architect?
 - Start thinking differently about the things you're already doing
 - Start from where you are, and work up
 - Influence is key

What to watch out for?
 - Bringing change - change is dangerous, people like the status quo
 - Reputation is about 50% of the game - you will never be immune to the system
 - Keep focussed

Define architecture in the context of the organisation


Knowing * to use a given technology
 - HOW, WHY OR WHETHER


WHAT IS ARCHITECTURE
 - Structure of the system
 -

ROLE OF ARCHITECT
 - Break down system into components
 - Bring it into context
 - From Buzzword to whether / why
 - Explains the meaningful decisions that have been made
    - Dangle the carrot
- Consider the constraints
    - work within them
    - dissolve the constraint

  Don't tell people they are wrong. Identify the parameters and give the equation for success
