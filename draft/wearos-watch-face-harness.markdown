Learnings:

### Motion layout
 - Used fragments for Side Sheets (https://material.io/components/sheets-side#specs)
 - So little boilerplate
 - Implement things like side menus
 - Puts the code in the XML where it belongs
 - Just used a TAG to detect which layer (realised fragment's promises weren't up to expectations - different layouts for different views - you ALWAYS need to have the same ID's across layouts)

### Hilt
 - Very easy DI

### Coroutines
 - Ream my blog
