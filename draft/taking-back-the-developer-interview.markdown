Power is important

> Fight with Jack. Randall was there. Handled well personally and with managers. Eventually left company.

Turn failures into successes.
> New interview, tell about the story with Jack. As I leave, Randall is going in for an interview after me. New manager asks about me, recalls his perception of the event. New manager fills in the blanks on my behalf



Asking questions:
1. Be specific about the things that you care about
2. Ask technical questions
   - Be ready for questions coming back
3. Question that relate to the company
   - Shows you did research

Best advice I ever got: Remember you are talking to people who relate better with your management than they do with you - so be cautious about the manner in which you might criticise them. Rather demonstrate understanding towards others

Questions I like to ask:
1. When do you start using dependency injection?
1.

Nice to haves
1. experience
1. portfolio
1. passion

Be on the lookout - are they asking you questions, or discovering things about you?
