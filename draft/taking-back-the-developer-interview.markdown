<!--

Power is important

> Fight with Jack. Randall was there. Handled well personally and with managers. Eventually left company.

Turn failures into successes.
> New interview, tell about the story with Jack. As I leave, Randall is going in for an interview after me. New manager asks about me, recalls his perception of the event. New manager fills in the blanks on my behalf



Asking questions:
1. Be specific about the things that you care about
2. Ask technical questions
   - Be ready for questions coming back
3. Question that relate to the company
   - Shows you did research
