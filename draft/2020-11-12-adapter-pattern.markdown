In my experience, one of the biggest cause of delays in software development is that of dependencies. It seems as though we're always waiting for something - designs, copy, data, decisions. However time spent waiting is time wasted. Especially when it comes to data.

> I remember as a third year student, we had to develop a system for a bank. The bank could afford to wait to give us test data, but we couldn't. We only had a very specific time frame and eventually we realised we needed to make it up ourselves.

The above experience is my first memory of dependency hell. The odd thing is, as a five year recurring judge at my [Universities Projects day][UJPROJECTSDAY] and as a software engineer I see it quite often. Teams and software delayed because of some other part of the system. I think the worst thing one can do, however, is simply wait for things to change.

Enter the [adapter pattern][WIKIADAPTER]:

Science (how things are done) vs Engineering(using solutions ) - sorting interface science is HOW TO SORT engineering is why do I need it sorted

Talk about interfaces (contracts) and abs classes (contracts with behaviour)

make it agnostic

use google as an example
