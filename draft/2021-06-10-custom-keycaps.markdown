I started by wanting to make custom DIY keycaps. I ended up learning a lot about succeeding at tasks in general.

I have written a lot of scripts to simplify my development work, and as a result, I wanted to make it easier to execute those scripts. I got into making custom macro pads (keyboards) with [QMK][1] and [CircuitPython][2]. However it became quite relevant for me that while I can build keyboards that have custom colours on the keys, those colours do not necessarily always communicate the action that I want to perform.

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

And there you go! This is a more granular approach to navigation of a device in accessibility mode for developers. I hope that it will help all sorts of people, as it could be used in automation testing or even remote control.

Here is a [link to the video][19] demonstrating the commands in action.
