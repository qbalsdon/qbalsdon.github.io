Obviously when you get called out in the middle of the night no one cares what you are wearing, as long as you are wearing something. The idea is make sure you are not trying the perform the role or follow the agenda you may have whilst going about your day-to-day.

The most important task on a production call out is to find the root cause, diagnose, delegate and determine next steps. You might be a software engineer, quality assurance tester or a scrum master by day, but by night you need to step in as the force of reason for figuring out the problem, and help resolve the issue as best and as quickly as possible. Your skills might come in handy, but more often than not I have found that experience can bring bias with it, especially when tensions are high and you are being rushed to fix a problem. Add fatigue and frustration, and people aren't exactly at their best.

Don't focus on your focus areas

Have defined roles. Don't be alone.
