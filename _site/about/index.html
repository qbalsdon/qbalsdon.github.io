<p>Welcome to Practical Android. This blog is a collection of my musings, ramblings and experiments. Originally from Johannesburg, South Africa, Iâ€™ve been programming since I was six, and developing Android applications since 2011. I have been fortunate enough to have completed a Masters Degree in computer science, and presented published at three international conferences in India, Turkey and Thailand.</p>
