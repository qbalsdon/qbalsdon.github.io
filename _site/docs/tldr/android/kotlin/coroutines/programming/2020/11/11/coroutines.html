<p>Ever since <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html">coroutines</a> were introduced I have been long suffered to read up about them. Whenever I do there always seems to be something in the way. It all seems complicated and long winded. I know we need asynchronous requests, I know threading is a thing. I’m tired of reading articles that defend threading, just show me how to coroutine.</p>

<p>In your app build.gradle:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin"><span class="n">implementation</span> <span class="err">'</span><span class="n">org</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">jetbrains</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">kotlinx</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">kotlinx-coroutines-android</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mf">1.3.9</span><span class="err">'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In your Activity:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin">    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">suspend</span> <span class="k">fun</span> <span class="nf">longRunningBackgroundThread</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nf">doSomeWork</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>

            <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="c1">// ...</span>

<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask">AsyncTasks</a> took me forever to adopt, however they eventually won me over because they were Android agnostic and could be used in several places without context. I’m not a fan of boilerplate and <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/run-background-service/create-service">Background Services</a> seemed overkill.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend reading the <a href="https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/coroutines-on-android-part-i-getting-the-background-3e0e54d20bb">Android Developers Blog</a> and if you have the time, do their <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-coroutines/#0">codelab</a>, as it takes the reader through testing coroutines. It seems like <a href="https://medium.com/@elizarov/coroutine-context-and-scope-c8b255d59055">coroutine scope</a> needs to come from the <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel">ViewModel</a> and Google is really pushing for that type of architecture, which I would also recommend. The approach above is designed to be very quick and I think it’s rather dirty.</p>

<p>I think the main reason for pushing the <a href="https://medium.com/@elizarov/coroutine-context-and-scope-c8b255d59055">coroutine scope</a> into the <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel">ViewModel</a> is that technically, that is where the decision to be asynchronous should be made. Your data layer should be written in a synchronous manner so that you can test it independently. And you should shy away from too much on an Activity / Fragment is because they’re so full of Android state you’ll need to be careful that it is terminated when the Activity / Fragment terminates, lest there be race conditions.</p>
